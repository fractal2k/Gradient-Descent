#### About the Author

I'm Sujay. Hehe

#### How can I contact you?

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sujay-rokade/){:target="_blank"}. Feel free to message me there if you have something to say. It might take a little while to respond though. I don't check LinkedIn everyday.

Also, if you're planning to email me, be warned because there's a high chance it will never reach my eyes. My email's a huge mess :'(
